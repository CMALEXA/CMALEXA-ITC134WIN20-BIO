Hello, 

My name is Conela Alexander and this is my first quarter at Seattle Central Community College. My goal is to graduate with a programming certificate from Seattle Central. I have several interests that fall within and outside of the programming certificate, so I hope to gain more than one certificate. I heard there'll be an analytical certificate being added to the department sometime this year, so I may take advantage of it.
